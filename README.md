We will be using Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection that is publicly available on Kaggle.
We will first build the model using simple custom layers convolutional neural networks and then evaluate it. At last, we will compute some prediction by the model and 
compare the results. The data set consists of two different folders that are Yes or No. Both 
the folders contain different MRI images of the patients. Yes folder has patients that have 
brain tumors whereas No folder has MRI images of patients with no brain tumor. There are 
a total of 155 images of positive patients of brain tumor and 98 images of other patients 
having no brain tumor.  
Brain tumor classification is highly relevant for several reasons. Firstly, it helps doctors 
determine the type of brain tumor a patient has, which in turn informs the treatment options 
that are available. Secondly, accurate classification of brain tumors can provide 
information on the tumor's behavior, such as how fast it is growing and how likely it is to 
spread to other parts of the brain or body. This information is crucial for determining the 
patient's prognosis and developing a treatment plan. Thirdly, brain tumor classification 
helps researchers better understand the biology of different types of brain tumors. This 
understanding can lead to the development of new and more effective treatments in the 
future.
